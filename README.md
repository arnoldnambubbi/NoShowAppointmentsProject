# NoShowAppointmentsProject
The No Show Appointments file has records of 110,527 patients in Brazil. It contains information such as the Patient's ID, Appointment ID, Gender,Appointment Day, Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, medical condition e.g (Hypertension,Diabetes,Alcoholism, Handcap), Whether they received an SMS and whether they showed up for their appointment.

We could try to answer different questions using this dataset. Below are some of the questions:
1.) Which medical conditions are most common with the patients?
2.) The average age of the patients?
3.) The neighbourhood where most of the patients come from and relate to the most common conditions in that area?
4.) How many of the patients receive SMS?
5.) How many of the patients honor their appointments?

I will be answering 3 questions. The questions are as below:

1.) Does receiving an SMS influence whether the patient will show up for their appointment?
2.) Are patients in the welfare program more likely to show up for their appointments?
3.) Is there a relationship between gender and patients showing up for their appointments?
